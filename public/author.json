She has been creating content for over 10 years, with a strong focus on software for the last five. The web backend is her forte, as well as newer technologies like machine learning, DevOps, and the cloud. Once in a while, she’ll pen down some new things she’s learning on dev.to or freecodecamp. She also attends hackathons and spoke at a Nairobi Atlassian event. When she’s not behind a computer, you’ll find her outdoors trying to connect with nature.",
